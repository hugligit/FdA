2.6 Personalised Learning Support
=================================

The need to provide learners with effective and appropriate support is
paramount.  Practitioners working within learning support need to provide
pupils with advice and guidance on current and future learning and/or personal
development as well as providing pastoral support.  This involves meeting
learners’ needs, planning for and providing them with access to appropriate
opportunities that will enable them to benefit from their experiences. This
module challenges learning support practitioners to look beyond their typical
responsibilities and activities to research more advanced support strategies
and personalised learning.
