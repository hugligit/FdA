2.4 Introduction to Action Research
===================================

Those supporting teaching and learning are often faced with a problem or issue
that requires them to take steps to improve the situation.  Action research
allows practitioners to address those concerns that are closest to them, ones
over which they can exhibit some influence and make change.  An important
aspect of this process is the ability to systematically describe the
issue/problem and arrive at a proposed solution. In addition, when conducting
research, one must be mindful of ethical and data protection issues. This
module introduces learners to research methodology and the skills and
techniques required to propose a small-scale action research project within
their workplace.
