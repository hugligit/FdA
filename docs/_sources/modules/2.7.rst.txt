2.7 Action Research Project
===========================

Action research is carried out within the context of the practitioner’s
environment—that is, with the pupils and at the educational setting in which
they work. Having conducted initial research, presented a review of literature
and proposed their research question, course members will continue this
systematic approach to complete a small-scale action research project within
their workplace with support from the module tutor and school-based mentor.
