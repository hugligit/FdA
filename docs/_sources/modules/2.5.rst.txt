Assessment
==========

.. admonition:: A reflective and written examination: 1500 words, LO1-3

   * Individual contribution to a handout and seminar process of a relevant and current issue or topic in Education (50 marks)
   * Collaboratively, you are to research and ensure a balanced, critical and analytical approach to a chosen and agreed issue or topic area experienced or in the process of being introduced, within education.  This could be a new initiative presented by DfE, a current issue seen in schools or in education as a whole.  Individually and collaboratively (as part of your Seminar partnership) critically analyse this situation which may affect or influence practice. You will then conduct a seminar of your peers to constructively gain, entice or change views and perspectives.  
   * In your seminar partnership, decide on one provocative question (per person) to examine individually for the written ‘Seminar Handout’. This will be the focus of your contribution and review during the seminar.  The handout will be presented to participants for critical analysis before and should be used during the seminar process and peer discussion. Ensure full collaboration with your fellow ‘seminar partners’ to avoid repetition of points and to ensure flow and momentum of critical discussion and information within the allocated time. 
   * Work together.  Share resources. Discuss and compare your findings.
   * Note:  You will not be able to research every aspect of the topic/issue. Therefore, concentrate solely on potential discussion regarding the critical elements of your research using your own provocative question.
   * Use diagrams, graphs or other illustrations to highlight statistics for discussion sparingly (not included in the word count).  Be creative to highlight supporting information and to use word count effectively and concisely.
   * Finally, within your contribution to the seminar handout, briefly conclude with comments on whether your research has changed your own opinion or given you further food for thought (first person).  Any points/aspects that you were unaware of?  What have you learned? Surprises? Disappointments? Further areas you wish to investigate?
   * 800 words + 10% (per person).
   * Reference list should appear at the end of your own contribution to the seminar handout.

.. admonition:: A written evaluation: 1500 words, LO4

   * You need to investigate, examine and evaluate the role of Ofsted and Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) as regulatory and inspection bodies in education.  You must use relevant literature and theory to support your arguments, statements, judgements and conclusions. 
   
   * Demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of regulatory bodies. Ensure you present varied and impartial viewpoint(s) and critical opinion.  Reference list should feature on a new page at the end of this written evaluation along with your Self-Assessment Target Front Sheet.
