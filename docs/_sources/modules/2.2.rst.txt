2.2 Reflection and Evaluation
=============================

Engaging in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is at the heart of
being a ‘professional’. Effective CPD requires careful consideration of
development needs, which are derived from the evaluation of and reflection
on own practice. The recognition and acknowledgement of a critical 
incident can be a driver for the identification of such needs.  In the
second year of their studies for the Foundation Degree, teaching
assistants are expected to build on and continue aspects of their
professional practice, completed in the first year. Reflection on and
critical evaluation of own practice is further developed, and more
emphasis is placed on the requirement to link theory to practice.

Aims
====

* Understand theories to support reflective practice
* Understand the process of reflection and evaluation to identify areas
  for further development
* Understand the relevance of critical incidents to extend their current
  repertoire of skills in supporting learners. 

Learning Outcomes
=================

#. Evaluate personal effectiveness in the performance of own role within
   their setting using a reflective practice model
#. Analyse and reflect upon 2 critical incidents
#. Identify areas for future development with a discussion of strategies
   to improve future practice
