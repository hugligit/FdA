2.3 Special Education Needs and Disabilities
============================================

A child has special educational needs if he or she has a learning difficulty
which calls for special educational provision.  The Special Educational Needs
and Disabilities framework makes an increasing assumption that children with
special educational needs and disabilities will be educated in mainstream
schools, thus requiring all schools to offer provision and support in an
effective manner.   Within this framework, which emphasises inclusion and
parental participation, duties require local educational authorities,
maintained schools and others to identify, assess and make provision for
children’s individual needs.  All pupils share the same statutory entitlement
to a broad, balanced, coherent and relevant curriculum and the challenge is to
ensure the work undertaken in schools and classrooms becomes more proactive and
effective in order to enhance such access in a supportive and knowledgeable
manner.  All members of the school team are required to join together to seek
out those factors which help or hinder access to the curriculum and to make
provision to support such need.

Aims
====

* Current legislation and codes of practice which define SEND
* To identify a range of special educational needs and those factors which help
  or hinder access to the curriculum
* Models of assessment and performance appraisal used for determining the
  learning needs of pupils
* Planning, provision and evaluation of appropriate and effective support for
  special educational needs


Learning Outcomes
=================

#. Review the characteristics which define special educational need and discuss
   current developments and changes within the field
#. Critically examine barriers to learning as well as the factors which may
   cause such barriers
#. Justify and assist in the planning and delivery of a learning strategy which
   involves a pupil with special educational needs in activities which enable
   access to a broad and balanced curriculum
#. Evaluate the implementation of an intervention designed to manage a specific
   special educational need
